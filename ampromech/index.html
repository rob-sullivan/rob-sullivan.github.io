            <p>Ampromech Consulting Ltd is a recently formed company. Its directors are Fergus Cawley and Niall Flaherty, 
              who combined have over 50 years’ experience in the design and installation of industrial, pharmaceutical and power generation projects.<br /><br />
              Over the last 10 years they have been largely focused on datacentre design and have worked with several hyper-scale datacentre companies. 
              Both Niall and Fergus have worked together during that timeframe under a different umbrella and have now decided to offer a more focused, 
              niche and responsive company to best serve the schedule and value driven requirements of the customer.<span id="dots" style="display: inline;"></span><br /><br />
              <span id="more" style="display: none;">Ampromech have a number of experienced engineers already on-board who have previously worked with Niall and Fergus on 
                datacentre projects over several years. The Ampromech philosophy is to create a strong core group of key people who are client focused 
                and who understand the fast pace and realities of the datacentre environment.</span>

            <div class="services-body">
              <p>As modern building design evolves and adapts to our needs, additional building services 
                lead to a more complex exercise in coordination. The common consensus is to resolve coordination 
                issues at the design stage before they arise onsite, leading to a more cost effective and aesthetic final installation.</p>
              <p>Building Information Modelling (BIM) processes and tools facilitate 3D visualization and representation of every building 
                component and material for designers, manufacturers, and installation teams. The end result for the client is a data rich 3D model, 
                fully representative of the installation physical properties, while also capable of storing as-built Operations and 
                Maintenance (O&M) documents and data sheets, building material thermal and space environmental properties, and parametric 
                interactions with the built environment.The BIM team at Ampromech pool several years of experience with BIM, spread across 
                numerous construction industry sectors:

                The team has worked with industry BIM standards, and has been involved with several BIM level 2 projects in both the UK and in Ireland. The team is familiar with drafting and following execution plans, employers’ requirements, and task delivery plans to BIM standards and protocols. 
                Staff are familiar and proficient with BIM software tools such as Revit, Navisworks, IES VE. These tools allow for Ampromech to design, coordinate, and simulate environmental conditions in a 3D environment in collaboration with all project stakeholders.

              <p>As well as power supply, we have 30 years experience in the specification and design of emergency power systems for critical applications using on-site diesel generation.</p>
              <p>More recently we have been heavily involved in CHP (combine heat and power) projects wherein electrical power is generated withing a facility using natural gas as a fuel,  and the heat generated during the combustion process is then harnessed and used to provide thermal energy for the facility in the form of steam and hotwater.</p>

Using SKM we can then generate a report identifying arc flash risks and boundaries and issue labels for all relevant equipment.</p>
